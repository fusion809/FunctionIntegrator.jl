Due to [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl)'s superior mathematics typesetting support (relative to plain GitHub-flavoured markdown), I have decided to move the README of this package to my Franklin-powered website, https://fusion809.github.io/FunctionIntegrator/.

Contributions are welcome! I should state, however, that I may at times become too busy to attend to bug reports and pull requests in a timely manner, so my apologies in advance for those times, it is not that I do not appreciate your attempts to contribute, it is just that I am busy.
